#introduction about me

I am Ananya Goraksha from Mechanical branch. I am working on the project titan legs design along with my co-mentee Sarvesh Patki who is also a fellow Mechanical student. We both will be working on this project under the guidance of our mentors Janhavi and Alqama. 

#introduction about the project

We are working on titan legs design, This project is concerned with creating, testing, and controlling a quadruped leg. We'll be understanding mathematical and kinematical ideas for effective mechanisms, aslo we'll be reviewing past designs of a quadruped leg and then designing our own version. Many quadruped projects like the MIT Cheetah, Stanford doggo, IISCstoch have been made, the research Papers published on these robots will be studied thoroughly for analysis and design aspects. 

#what I look forward to in this project

Myself being a mechanical student, I am super interested in the design aspect. As we will be making around 3-4 rough designs and then finalizing the best one because of this, we will learn more about the various systems that can be used to make a robot and how some are better then the others.

#challenges that I think I will face

I think my biggest challenge would be the controls systems of the robot. We'll be using ROS for operating the quadruped. ROS uses python as it's language and I have no prior experience in python so I'll be starting that from scratch. I think it'll be fun and interesting to learn something from scratch.
